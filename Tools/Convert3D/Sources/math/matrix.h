/** Mathematical structure for 3D transformations. Good for storing a
	stack of transformations and can transform points efficiently.

	Since matrices are layed out in a 2D array, the indexing can be done in two ways:
	row-major, and column-major.

	Column-major indexing (like OpenGL)...
		| 0  4  8 12 |
		| 1  5  9 13 |
		| 2  6 10 14 |
		| 3  7 11 15 |

 	Row-major indexing (like DirectX)...
		| 0  1  2  3 |
		| 4  5  6  7 |
		| 8  9 10 11 |
		|12 13 14 15 |

	Regardless of how the values are layed out in memory, the math always works the same. (Row * Column)
		| - - - - |   | - - # - |   | - - - - |
		| # # # # | * | - - # - | = | - - # - |
		| - - - - |   | - - # - |   | - - - - |
		| - - - - |   | - - # - |   | - - - - |

	So, if our vectors are considered row-major, the only valid way to multiply the vector by the matrix is on the left, v * M
	and conversely if our vectors were column-major, the only valid way to multiply would be if the vector was on the right M * v

		Row-Major: ( v * M )						Column-Major: ( M * v )
					| - - # - |						| - - - - |   | x |   | - |
		[x y z w] * | - - # - | = [- - # -]			| # # # # | * | y | = | # |
					| - - # - |						| - - - - |   | z |   | - |
					| - - # - |						| - - - - |   | w |   | - |

	So when it comes to matrix multiplication order, how can you tell which way to multiply?
	Well if you want to transform a vector by a series of matrices, the first matrix it is transformed by is the most local.
	So, to transform by the chain of bones A,B,C (where A is the root):
		In column-major, it's left to right A*B*C*v.
		In row-major, it's right to left v*C*B*A


	A 2D array in C/C++ like this:
	Scalar [][4] matrix = {
		{ a, b, c, d },
		{ e, f, g, h },
		{ i, j, k, l },
		{ m, n, o, p }};

	Will be stored in memory like this: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p.

	This library uses row major format.

// TODO:
// * Support shear, reflection, and projection
// * Orthonormalize
// * Remember tricks like, if you have a shear matrix you can still rotate vectors but you have to do
//   extra work, like 


#include <iostream>

#include "quaternion.h"
#include "vector.h"

#include "impl/matrix_impl.h"

// the design idea here is:
// great, simple API
// with inline calls to a simple C++ implementation.
// If anyone wants to port this library to work with their own math... the interface will be the same
// they just have to replace the inline calls to call their own impl, and swap out the whole library.

// It could be fancier, without having to have the user recompile the lbirary using some template meta
// magic, but this sounds kind of pointless "elegance".
// I imagine it like:
// template <typename Impl>
// typedef Matrix<Impl> Matrix;
// Then there can be an instance like:
//
// Impl _impl;
//
// and assumed calls like _impl.Whatever();
//
// However, I feel like this either requires a second layer of abstraction that has to be implemeneted to
// wrap a client library, or a lot of assumptions made. So in the end, why bother? It's meant to be
// light weight which means, so simple devs should feel ok diving in and copying the core library to
// wrap their own.
